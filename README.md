# Digital Pumpkin Carver üéÉ

Welcome to the Digital Pumpkin Carver\! This is a simple, fun, front-end-only web application that works like a "Mr. Potato Head" for pumpkins.

Drag, drop, resize, and rotate parts like eyes, noses, mouths, and hats onto a blank pumpkin to create your own spooky (or silly) jack-o'-lantern. When you're done, you can download your creation as a high-quality PNG.

This project is **perfect for Hacktoberfest** and first-time open-source contributors\! We actively welcome your help.

### The Easiest Way to Contribute: Add an Asset\!

The most fun way to contribute is by adding your own custom-drawn parts to the toolbox.

1.  **Create Your Part:**

      * Draw a new eye, mouth, hat, scar, or any other accessory.
      * It **must** be a **transparent `.png`** file (e.g., `spooky-eye.png` or `clown-nose.png`).
      * A good size to aim for is around 100x100 pixels, but any size will work.

2.  **Add Your File:**

      * Fork this repository.
      * Add your new `.png` file to the `assets/` folder (or create it if it doesn't exist).

3.  **Add it to the Toolbox:**

      * Open `index.html`.
      * Find the `<div id="toolbox">` section.
      * Add a new `<img>` tag for your part, just like the others:
        ```html
        <img 
            src="assets/your-new-part.png" 
            alt="A cool new part" 
            class="asset" />
        ```

4.  **Submit a Pull Request\!**

      * Commit your changes and open a PR. We'll review it and get it merged.

### Other Ways to Contribute

  * Find and fix a bug.
  * Add a new feature (e.g., a "Delete Part" button, a "Clear All" button, or layer controls).
  * Improve the CSS or mobile responsiveness.
  * Refactor the JavaScript to make it cleaner.

We welcome all contributions. Just fork the repo, make your changes, and send a PR\!
